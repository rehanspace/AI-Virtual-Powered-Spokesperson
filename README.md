# AI-Virtual-Powered-Spokesperson
Developed an AI-powered system to mimic a specific voice and simulate appearances via a 3D avatar. Integrated deep learning to create realistic deep fake videos using user-provided inputs, synchronizing facial expressions and audio. Added a text-to-speech (TTS) engine for generating audio-visual outputs from text.
Designed and developed an AI-powered system to synthesize speeches in a specific individual's voice and simulate their appearance through a 3D avatar.
Built a neural network model trained on high-quality audio datasets of the individualâ€™s speeches to replicate their tone, pitch, and style.
Integrated a deep learning-based generative model for creating realistic deep fake videos, where users can provide an image or video as input to generate personalized outputs based on facial expressions and audio synchronization.
Integrated a text-to-speech (TTS) engine, enabling users to input text and generate audio-visual outputs.
Applications include educational content creation, interactive media experiences, and advancements in AI-based audio and visual simulation.

[9:18 pm, 14/01/2025] SHAFAN AHMAD: # Text-to-Speech (TTS) Project

This project implements a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using Python libraries like gTTS. It enables users to convert text input into speech audio files.

## Features
- Converts text input into natural-sounding speech.
- Supports multiple languages (based on gTTS capabilities).
- Simple and user-friendly interface for generating audio files.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: txtToSpeech_(1) (1) (1).ipynb.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to provide text input.
3. Generate and save the audio output.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- Requests library for HTTP operations

## Output
The generated audio files are saved in the project directory and can be played using any media player.
